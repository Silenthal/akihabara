## What's New

### AkihabaraMediaBox
I have implemented a media portion of the framework. I have been building a game using Akihabara, hence this forked version and all the updates. The AkihabaraMediaBox instance is an instance of [MediaBox](https://github.com/kitajchuk/jsource/blob/master/src/MediaBox.js) from my [JSource](https://github.com/kitajchuk/jsource/) repository.

### Akihabara Dist Files
You can load any of the files from the dist directory depending on what type of game you are making. The following dist files exist:
 - akihabara.topview.js
 - akihabara.platformer.js
 - akihabara.shmup.js
